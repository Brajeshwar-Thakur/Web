<center><b><h3>HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training)</h3></b></center>
<p>

How It Works

As you can tell from the name, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is challenging. It takes your cardio workout to another level, as you push your pace out of your comfort zone.

You can use HIIT with any type of cardio workout, whether it's running, using a stair climbing machine, rowing, or jumping rope.

You�ll work up a sweat fast, working at a very intense level and then backing off for a slower recovery period, followed by another round of high intensity.

That strategy can save you time: You don't have to work out as long as you would if you were keeping a steady pace.

You�ll lose weight, build muscle, and boost your metabolism. Plus there�s a post-workout bonus: Your body will burn calories for about 2 hours after you exercise.
Intensity Level: High

You�ll work harder than you do when you do a typical cardio workout. But you�ll do it in spurts of 30 seconds to 3 minutes. Then you�ll have a chance to recover for about the same amount of time or longer.
Areas It Targets

Core: No. This workout doesn�t target your core.

Arms: No. This workout doesn't target your arms.

Legs: No. This workout doesn�t target your legs. But cardio exercises like running and biking can strengthen your legs.

Glutes: No. This workout doesn't target your glutes. But if you do cardio exercises that work your glutes, like stair-climbing, your glutes will get a workout.

Back: No. This workout doesn't target your back.
Type

Flexibility: No. This workout doesn�t focus on improving flexibility.

Aerobic: Yes. This is a powerful cardio workout.

Strength: This workout can help you build muscle. Choose weight lifting as your high-intensity activity for an extra boost in strength.

Sport: No.

Low-Impact: No. But if you work out on an elliptical trainer, it may be low-impact.
What Else Should I Know?

Cost: Free.

Good for beginners? Yes. You can start slowly with just 3-4 speed intervals, then ramp it up as you get better.

Outdoors: Yes. Run or bike outdoors. You can even try chasing your dog for each speed interval.

At home: Yes. This is a great workout to use on the treadmill or stationary bike. Or you can do weight-lifting intervals at home.

Equipment required? None, unless you plan to work out on cardio equipment like a treadmill or stair-climbing machine, or with a weight set.
What Physical Therapist Ross Brakeville Says:

If you exercise regularly, HITT is a great alternative to your routine. Plus, this high intensity workout really gets the feel-good endorphins flowing.

HITT is not for everyone. You need great motivation and physical stamina to push yourself to the limit. If you�re not used to this type of training, your muscles and joints may pay the price through sprains and strains.

Is It Good for Me If I Have a Health Condition?

Getting and staying fit is part of managing conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease. And HIIT is a great way to lose weight and boost your overall health.

This workout places big demands on your heart, so you should check in with your doctor to see if HIIT is OK for you. You should also start slowly, doing a few intervals for a short period of time.

You may not be able to do HIIT if you have joint or muscle problems, like arthritis. Ask your doctor first.

If you're pregnant, you did HITT before pregnancy, and you don�t have any other medical issues, then it may be a safe option for you during your first trimester, but check with your doctor first.

In the second and third trimesters, your growing belly is going to limit your activity. You should only do high-impact training if you have your doctor�s approval. Make sure you drink plenty of water and don�t overheat.

<center><b><h3>Calisthenics</h3></b></center>
<p>Calisthenics is a type of workout that uses a person�s body weight with little or no equipment.

The exercises involve movements that use large muscle groups, such as pushups. People typically perform these exercises at a moderate pace. They help to improve coordination, flexibility, and strength.

Calisthenics originated in Ancient Greece and remains popular today. Most people can perform these exercises, regardless of the level of their athletic ability. Many of them do not require any equipment.
Calisthenics exercises and how to do them

Here is a list of 10 common calisthenics exercises and instructions on how to do them.
Squats

    Start by standing with the feet shoulder-width apart.
    Bend the knees and push the hips back, as if sitting down on a chair.
    Squat down as far as possible.
    From the bottom of the movement, push with the legs to return up. 

Keep the head and back straight during this exercise. Avoid extending the knees farther than the toes as this can damage the knee joints.
Pushups

    Start in a face-down position on the floor.
    Place the hands flat on the floor slightly wider than the shoulders, with the elbows facing the toes.
    Extend the legs backward, with the toes on the ground.
    Tighten the core muscles to keep the body in a straight line.
    Straighten the arms and push the ground away from you to raise the body.
    Bend the arms and lower the body until the chest almost touches the ground.

While doing a pushup, keep the elbows from flaring outward. To make the pushup easier, start with the knees resting on the ground.
Crunches

    Start by laying on the back with the feet flat on the floor, bending the knees at a 90-degree angle.
    Cross the hands over the chest.
    Engage the core muscles and curl the upper body toward the knees.
    Hold the position for a moment before returning to the floor.

Keep the head and next relaxed while lifting the upper body.
Plank

    Get into a pushup position but with the forearms flat on the ground.
    Flex the core muscles to keep the body in a straight line.
    Hold the position for as long as possible without letting the hips drop downward.

Burpees

    Start by standing with feet shoulder-width apart.
    Bend the knees and lower into a squat position until the palms can touch the ground.
    From the bottom of the squat, jump down into a plank position, landing on the balls of the feet.
    From the plank position, jump to swing the legs forward, so the feet reach the hands.
    Jump upward with the hands in the air, returning to a standing position.

Lunges

    Start by standing up straight with the feet in a neutral position.
    Step the right foot in front of the body, bending the knee at a right angle.
    The left knee should almost touch the floor as the leg extends.
    Use the heel of the right foot to push back up to a standing position, bringing both feet together.
    Repeat for the left leg.

Pullups

This exercise requires a pullup bar.

    Stand facing the pullup bar.
    Grip the bar in an overhand grip (palms facing away) and hands at or wider than shoulder-width apart.
    Use the shoulder and arm muscles to pull the body up until the head is over the bar.
    Slowly drop the body back down under the bar.

Chin-ups

This exercise also requires a pullup bar.

    Stand in front of the pullup bar.
    Grip the bar in an underhand grip (palms facing toward the body) and hands closer or at shoulder-width apart.
    Use the bicep muscles to pull the body up until the chin is over the bar.
    Return under the bar.

Jump rope

This exercise requires a jump rope.

    Grasp the jump rope by its handle.
    Keep the arms the same width from the center of the body.
    Rotate the rope with the wrists to swing the rope over and under the body.
    Jump over the rope, letting it clear beneath the feet.
    Keep a slight bend in the knees and point the toes to protect the ankle and knee joints.

Dips

This exercise requires a dip bar.

    Start by standing inside the dip bar.
    Grip both sides with the hands.
    Bend the elbows back and push with the tricep muscles to move up and down.

<p>Upper body
Pectorals (chest)
Smith machine bench press

    The bench press or dumbbell bench-press is performed while lying face up on a bench, by pushing a weight away from the chest. This is a compound exercise that also involves the triceps and the front deltoids, also recruits the upper and lower back muscles, and traps. The bench press is the king of all upper body exercises and is one of the most popular chest exercises in the world. It is the final exercise in 'The big 3'.
        Equipment: dumbbells, barbell, Smith machine or bench press machine.
        Major variants: incline ~ (more emphasis on the upper pectorals), decline ~ (more emphasis on the lower pectorals), narrow grip ~ (more emphasis on the triceps), push-up (face down using the body weight), neck press (with the bar over the neck, to isolate the pectorals), vertical dips (using parallel dip bars) or horizontal dips (using two benches with arms on the near bench and feet on the far bench, and dropping the buttocks to the floor and pushing back up.)

Dumbbell flye

    The chest fly is performed while lying face up on a bench or standing up, with arms outspread holding weights, by bringing the arms together above the chest. This is a compound exercise for the pectorals. Other muscles worked include deltoids, triceps, and forearms.
        Equipment: dumbbells, cable machine or "pec deck" machine.
        Major variants: incline ~ (more emphasis on the upper pectorals), decline ~ (more emphasis on the lower pectorals), cable crossover.
    Cable crossovers

<br>
<center><b><h3>Lats (mid back) Pulldown machine</h3></b></center>
<p> 

    The pulldown is performed while seated by pulling a wide bar down towards the upper chest or behind the neck. This is a compound exercise that also involves the biceps, forearms, and the rear deltoids.
        Equipment: cable machine or pulldown machine.
        Major variants: chin-up or pullup (using the body weight while hanging from a high bar), close grip ~ (more emphasis on the lower lats), reverse grip ~ (more emphasis on the biceps).

    The Pull-up is performed by hanging from a chin-up bar above head height with the palms facing forward (supinated) and pulling the body up so the chin reaches or passes the bar. The pull-up is a compound exercise that also involves the biceps, forearms, traps, and the rear deltoids. A chin-up (palms facing backwards) places more emphasis on the biceps and a wide grip pullup places more emphasis on the lats. As beginners of this exercise are often unable to lift their own bodyweight, a chin-up machine can be used with counterweights to assist them in the lift.
        Equipment: chin-up bar or chin-up machine.

Dumbbell bent-over row

    The bent-over row is performed while leaning over, holding a weight hanging down in one hand or both hands, by pulling it up towards the abdomen. This is a compound exercise that also involves the biceps, forearms, traps, and the rear deltoids. The torso is unsupported in some variants of this exercise, in which case lifting belts are often used to help support the lower back.
        Equipment: dumbbell, barbell, Smith machine or T-bar machine.
        Major variants: cable row (using a cable machine while seated)</p>
